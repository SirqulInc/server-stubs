    * @param message The message to send
    * @param contentId The payload content ID that gets sent along with the message. For push notification, this could be used in client apps to know what the message is referring to and open up the related view.
    * @param contentName The payload content name that gets sent along with the message. For push notification, this could be used in client apps to know what the message is referring to and open up the related view.
    * @param contentType The payload content type that gets sent along with the message. For push notification, this could be used in client apps to know what the message is referring to and open up the related view.

    * @param conditionalInput Json input representing conditional logic that has to be met before running the scheduled notification

The available types include: REPORTING - saves an adhoc report to be able to run again at another time GEOFENCE_OWNER - template for sending notifications to the geofence/audience owner (i.e. the business owner) GEOFENCE_OWNER - template for sending notifications to the geofence/audience owner (i.e. the business employee, retailer location, etc) GEOFENCE_TRIGGER - template for sending notifications to the account that triggered the geofence/audience (i.e. the customer) GEOFENCE_HTTP_CALL - template for making http calls when the geofences are triggered
    * @param visibility Determines the scope of who is able to find and view the scheduled notification (PUBLIC - openly available to all Sirqul users, PRIVATE - only available to users that have been invited)

  /**
    * Search Scheduled Notifications
    * This endpoint searches on Scheduled Notifications. If a scheduled notification was created with the visibility parameter set to PUBLIC, then anyone can search on it if the filter parameter includes the PUBLIC value. PRIVATE visibility means that it can only be searched on by the owner or if it has been shared to the user using the UserPermissionsApi.  In addition, if a PUBLIC Scheduled Notification was created for an application that requires content approval (using the publicContentApproval parameter), then an administrator of the application needs to approve it before it can be search on by other users. Before this happens, it is in a PENDING state, and only the original creator or the owner of the application can search and see it. Also, only the owner of the application can use the UserPermissionsApi to approve or reject it. Scheduled notifications that have been rejected are only visible to the original creators.
    * @param accountId The logged in user.
    * @param groupingId Filter results by a grouping identifier defined by the client
    * @param audienceId Filter results by audience
    * @param filter a comma separated list of filters: MINE - Return scheduled notifications that the user has created.

FOLLOWER - Return scheduled notifications that have been created by the users followers (the content needs to have been APPROVED or FEATURED). FOLLOWING - Return scheduled notifications that have been created by people who the user is following (the content needs to have been APPROVED or FEATURED). PUBLIC - Return all PUBLIC scheduled notifications that have been APPROVED or FEATURED. ALL_PUBLIC - Return all PUBLIC scheduled notifications regardless of whether they are approved or not (ignores the approval status). LIKED - Return all scheduled notifications that the user has liked. FEATURED - Return all scheduled notifications that have been featured. PENDING - Return all pending scheduled notifications.
    * @param types Filter results by notification types (comma separated list). Values include: HTTP, EMAIL, SMS, MOBILE_NOTIFICATION

    * @param contentTypes search using content types
    * @param parentIds search using parent IDs
    * @param parentTypes search using parent types

    * @param templateTypes 
    * @param appKey Filter the list by a specific application
    * @param keyword Keyword search on the scheduled notification names.
    * @param sortField The field to sort by.
